# KING DOMINO GAME RULES

## Introduction
You are a King seeking new lands to expand your Kingdom. You must explore the different terrains: wheat fields, lakes, mountains, villages, forests and gardens in order to develop the best territories. But be careful, as other Kings are also coveting these lands...

## Object of the Game
The object is to build your kingdom in a 5 x 5 grid by connecting dominoes with matching terrains. The more matching terrain you have and the more crowns there are, the more points you get.

## Set-up:
Place the box of the game the following way:
Each player takes:
- 2 players game: two kings of their chosen color.
- 3 and 4 players game: one king in their chosen color.

Each player takes a starting tile (a single square) and a castle matching their kings’ color. Place the tile, face up, in front of you and place the castle on it.

Shuffle the dominoes. Place the dominoes in the box to form the draw pile with the numbers facing out.
- 2 players game: use 24 randomly selected dominoes.
- 3 players game: use 36 randomly selected dominoes.
- 4 players game: use all 48 dominoes.

From the draw pile, take the same number of dominoes as the number of kings in play (i.e. three dominoes for a 3 players game and four dominoes for a 2 or 4 players game). Display the dominoes in ascending order (the lowest number is always placed next to the box). Now you are ready to turn the dominoes over to see the terrain side.

For the starting turn only, one player takes all the kings in their hand. Then one at a time, players randomly select a king from the hand, and places that king on a domino tile of their choice. (It may not be your own colored king this time around).
Each domino tile can only have one king. This means that the last player to go doesn’t have a choice of tile, and must place it on the remaining tile. (In a 2 players game, each player will choose 2 dominoes, one for each of their kings).

When all the dominoes have a king on, select new tiles from the front of the draw pile. Place them in ascending order next to the line with the kings on. Turn the new tiles over to reveal the landscape images. You will now have two lines with dominoes, one with kings on.


## Playing the Game
The playing order is determined by the position of the kings on the first line of dominoes. The player whose king is placed on the 1st domino closest to the box (the one with the lowest number), starts. That player must take the following actions:
1. Add the domino with their king onto their territory according to the connection rules.
2. Choose a new domino in the new line by placing their king on it.

Now, it is the turn of the player whose king is on the second domino to take their two actions, and so on, until the last player has taken their two actions.
Then form a new line of dominoes and a new turn can start.
In a 2 players game, each player will take the 1 and 2 actions twice, once for each of their kings. Then form a new line of dominoes and a new turn can start.
The game is played over 12 turns in a 3 or 4 players game, and only 6 turns in a 2 players game (as each player plays twice each turn).


## Connection rules:
The players must build their kingdom in a 5x5 grid (each domino is composed of two territory squares). 
In order to place down their domino, the player must:
- Either connect it to their starting tile (the starting domino can be considered as a wild domino, any terrain can be connected to this domino),
- Or connect it to another domino, matching at least 1 of its terrains (horizontally or vertically only).

If you can’t add a domino to your territory following these rules, the domino must be discarded. All your dominoes must fit in a 5x5 grid. If, due to bad planning, one or more of your dominoes does not fit, discard that domino. You do not get points for discarded tiles.


## End of the game
When the last dominoes are lined up the players will take one last turn. Each player should now have in front of them a 5x5 grid forming their kingdom. (Some kingdoms may not be complete if a player was forced to discard any dominoes – see above). Now, each player can calculate the points for their kingdoms in the following way:

A kingdom is composed of different TERRITORIES; squares with the same type of terrain, that are connected horizontally or vertically.

Count the number of connected territory squares and multiply that number of squares by the number of crowns that appear in that territory.

You can have multiple crowns within a territory.

A territory without a crown will give you no points.
For example, if you have 7 forest squares connected and you have 3 crowns in that forest you multiply 7x3 to get a score of 21. If you have 9 lake squares connected but no crowns you will score 0 points.

Add up the scores for each of your territories and the player with the highest score is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the biggest territory (with the highest number of squares) wins the game. If it is still a tie, the player who has the most crowns wins the game. If it is still a tie, the players share the victory. 


## Additionnal rules

**Dynasty**: Play 3 rounds in a row. At the end of the 3 rounds, the player with the highest number of points wins the game.

**The middle Kingdom**: score 10 additional points if your castle is in the center of your territory.

**Harmony**: score 5 additional points if yourterritory is complete (no discarded dominoes).

**The Mighty Duel**: With 2 players. After one or two practice games, the real champions battle to build the largest kingdoms: use ALL the dominoes to build a 7x7 grid. You can mix these different variants if you want according to what you prefer.
